# How to commit

When making commits, please use the [Commitzen Conventional Commit Standards](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json).

Adhering to these standards allows us to effectively communicate implied information through commit messages which promotes
a great work ethic and ease-of-fixing issues.
